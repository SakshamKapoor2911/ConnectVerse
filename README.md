## üåü Core Concept

A mobile-first social application focused on real-time user interaction and performance. This project demonstrates the ability to build engaging, product-centric software with a focus on smooth user experience, low-latency communication, and efficient data handling - core values that align with Meta's vision of connecting people.

    end
```

The system uses a client-server architecture optimized for real-time communication. The React Native mobile client communicates with a Node.js backend via REST API for standard operations and WebSocket connections for real-time features. PostgreSQL serves as the primary database, with Redis used for caching to reduce latency and improve user experience.

## üì± Key Features

- [ ] User authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- [ ] Friend request system (send, accept, decline)
- [ ] A simple "wall" or "feed" where users can see posts from friends
- [ ] Real-time one-on-one chat using WebSockets (`socket.io`)
- [ ] Live notifications pushed to the client via WebSockets
- [ ] Efficiently storing and retrieving user data from PostgreSQL
- [ ] Caching frequently accessed data (like user profiles) in Redis

## üöÄ Technology Stack

| Category | Technology | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| **Frontend** | React Native + TypeScript | Cross-platform mobile development, aligns with Meta's mobile-first approach |
| **Backend** | Node.js + Express | JavaScript ecosystem consistency, excellent for real-time applications |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | ACID compliance for user data integrity, excellent for relational social data |
| **Real-time** | Socket.IO | Industry standard for WebSocket management, handles connection scaling |
| **Caching** | Redis | In-memory performance for frequently accessed social feeds and profiles |
| **Testing** | Jest + Detox | Comprehensive unit/integration testing + E2E mobile app testing |
| **Deployment** | Heroku/Fly.io | Rapid deployment with built-in scaling capabilities |

## üß† Engineering Challenges & Solutions

### **Challenge 1: Real-time WebSocket Connection Management**
* **Problem:** Managing thousands of concurrent WebSocket connections for real-time chat and notifications without memory leaks or performance degradation.
* **Solution:** Implement connection pooling with Socket.IO rooms, automatic reconnection logic, and heartbeat mechanisms. Use Redis adapter for horizontal scaling across multiple server instances.

### **Challenge 2: Mobile App Performance Optimization**
* **Problem:** Ensuring smooth 60fps performance on both iOS and Android while handling real-time data updates.
* **Solution:** Implement efficient React Native FlatList with getItemLayout, use React.memo for component optimization, and implement selective re-rendering based on data changes.

### **Challenge 3: Efficient Social Feed Caching**
* **Problem:** Delivering personalized feeds to users quickly while maintaining data freshness.
* **Solution:** Multi-layer caching strategy using Redis for user sessions and frequently accessed posts, with intelligent cache invalidation based on user interactions.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- React Native development environment (Xcode for iOS, Android Studio for Android)
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis 6+
- iOS Simulator or Android Emulator
